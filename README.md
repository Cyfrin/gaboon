# Gaboon

A fast, pythonic, Vyper smart contract testing and development framework.

[![Rye](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astral-sh/rye/main/artwork/badge.json)](https://rye.astral.sh)


## MVP requirements

- [x] Initialize a project (`gab init`)
- [ ] Compile vyper projects (`gab compile`/`gab build`)
- [ ] Test vyper projects (`gab test`)
- [ ] Deploy vyper projects (`gab run <script>`)
- [ ] Import/generate keystores (`gab wallet import`)
- [ ] Install packages `gab install <pypi_project>`
- [ ] Manage networks `gab networks <add|remove|list>`

Should be fast to install and test. 

## Background

The Gaboon viper (Bitis gabonica), also called the Gaboon adder, is a viper species found in the rainforests and savannas of sub-Saharan Africa.[1][3][2] Like all other vipers, it is venomous. It is the largest member of the genus Bitis,[4][5] and has the longest fangs of any venomous snake – up to 2 inches (5 cm) in length – and the highest venom yield of any snake.[5][6] No subspecies are recognized.[3][7]


## Later

- [ ] `gab install (<github_repo> | <pypi_project>)` 
- [ ] halmos built-in
- [ ] fuzzing 
- [ ] `gab console`
